Argentina pve / pvp community
Comunidad Argentina pve / pvp


The truth is that I was very surprised with the number of scripts and the active community that has azeroth core. As a developer, I will try to contribute as much as I can.

Separation into modules helps keep the core clean. Allowing developers to program things that don't directly affect the core.
